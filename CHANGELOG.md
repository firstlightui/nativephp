# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Theme-backed List Item leading/trailing icon tones and explicit hex icon colours on iOS and Android.
- `Feedback::fake()` with sent-record queries and assertions, including action keys.

### Fixed

- Document List pagination with NativePHP's supported `@endReached` event spelling.
- Share warning/on-warning theme tokens and accessible amber fallbacks across Status Label, Callout, and Feedback.
- Apply the resolved field name and hint to iOS Text Field's editable and secure inputs.
- Treat null or empty List Item supporting/trailing text as absent.

### Known limitations

- Blur-bound inputs do not guarantee publication before a separate button press; use live binding for button-submitted forms.
- Packagist `dev-main` was stale during investigation; a package maintainer must inspect its auto-update/app settings outside this repository.
